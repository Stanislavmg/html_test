    <h1>How reindeer help fight climate change</h1>
    <h2>Reindeer in Lapland have a number of important jobs this time of year – including helping the climate. By gobbling up shrubs, they help increase the reflectivity of snow and ice.</h2>
    <p>t's just after lunchtime, and darkness is already falling. Tiia Jeremejeff, a reindeer herder in northern Finland, jumps on a snowmobile to go and feed her family's herd, who are kept in a large enclosure in the winter. Her breath freezes almost instantly in the bitter cold – it's -15C (5F) here in Kierinki, 110km (68 miles) north of the Arctic Circle. There is a thick cover of snow in the forest, some 20cm (7.9in) deep.</p>
    <p>"It's not easy, being a reindeer herder," says Jeremejeff, a woman of Sami descent whose livelihood and culture is tightly intertwined with reindeer-herding. "It's a harsh climate and we have to go out and feed them no matter how cold it gets."</p>
    <p>Now, emerging evidence suggests reindeer may <a href="https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1749-8198.2009.00250.x" target="_blank"> a fundamental role in helping to preserve this entire ecosystem</a>, including the snow cover, the open forest with its low-growing berry bushes, mosses and lichen – an organism formed by a close association of fungi and algae – and even the cold winter climate. Research suggests that grazing reindeer may in fact help to fight some of the effects of climate change in the Arctic, which is warming <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3#Sec6" target="_blank"> times faster than the rest of the planet.</a></p>
    <p>Called "shrubification", the growth of taller, woodier plants happens as an open landscape gradually transforms into a forest. Shrub and forest cover may generally sound desirable, but in the case of the Arctic landscape, it could erase an ancient ecosystem characterised by open forests, known as boreal forests, and the treeless Arctic tundra. Shrubification may also worsen the impact of climate change, as research suggests that shrubs trap heat that thaw the permafrost and warm up the tundra.</p>

    <p>Scientists have also studied whether reindeer affect a landscape's carbon emissions. In one study, they measured the CO2 levels inside and outside reindeer enclosures in boreal forests <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259221345_Impact_of_reindeer_herding_on_vegetation_biomass_and_soil_carbon_content_A_case_study_from_Sodankyla_Finland" target="_blank"> establish if the undergrowth acts as a carbon sink or a carbon source.</a> One theory is that shrub growth could lead to greater CO2 emissions as it generates more biomass, or rotting plant matter. The undergrowth, which consists largely of lichen, moss and low-growing lingonberry and blueberry bushes, is thought to produce less decomposing biomass, since the plants are smaller.</p>
